      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <li>Q: What's the best way to cook a rubber chicken?</li>
      <p>
        A: We recommend simmering it in a pot of boiling water for several
        hours, or until it reaches an internal temperature of at least 165
        degrees F. It may not be the most delicious, but it will definitely be
        done!
      </p>

      <li>Q: Can I use your recipes to impress my significant other?</li>
      <p>
        A: Yes, but we cannot guarantee the results. We suggest using the recipe
        as a starting point and adding your own personal touch to make it truly
        unique.

      <li>Q: Can I substitute tofu for meat in your recipes?</li>
      <p>
        A: Sure, but keep in mind that tofu doesn't taste like meat. It has its
        own flavor and texture. But, who doesn't love a good Tofu Stir Fry?
      </p>

      <li>Q: Do you have any recipes for leftovers?</li>
      <p>
        A: Yes, we have a whole section dedicated to recipes that can be made
        with leftovers. Just add some creativity and a sprinkle of magic, and
        you'll have a whole new dish!

      <li>Q: My cookies always come out flat, what am I doing wrong?</li>
      <p>A: Are you sure you're not sitting on them?</p>
